<p>New hobby-project programming languages are released all the time, you would correctly argue; what makes this one special?</p>
<p>The answer is a number of design choices which <code>promote</code> speed and safety: V is tiny and very fast. It’s also in a self-proclaimed alpha state, and though it’s already been used to build some interesting projects, is still at an early stage.</p>
<h2>Tell me more</h2>
<p>V’s website, <a href="https://vlang.io">vlang.io</a>, states <code>that</code> it is a</p>
<p>Simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of these keywords is a cornerstone of V’s philosophy, which will crop up throughout this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Maintainable software” hints at V’s very deliberate design choices, which force developers into certain ways of thinking. In many ways, V is similar to Go, which makes similar design choices that some would consider bold.</p>
<p>For example no exceptions and no traditional classes/inheritance. V claims to be inspired by Go and influenced by Oberon, Rust, and Swift.</p>
<h2>So just how fast is it?</h2>
<p>Strict policies are put in place to attempt to make V as safe as possible, especially with respect to threading. These policies include:</p>
<h2>Error handling</h2>
<p>V does not have exceptions, much like Go. We think [Dave Cheney] does a good job of explaining why.</p>
<p>Instead, there’s a combined Option/Result type, which is as simple to use as adding ? to the return type and optionally returning an error. Here’s an example of how it might work:</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    code: \"code\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    blockquote: \"blockquote\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"If you stay up to date with niche software news, your ears may recently have twitched at the release of a new programming language: V.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"New hobby-project programming languages are released all the time, you would correctly argue; what makes this one special?\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"The answer is a number of design choices which \", _jsx(_components.code, {\n        children: \"promote\"\n      }), \" speed and safety: V is tiny and very fast.
